The user can introduce from the keyboard a product that will be added in the cart if it exists. When the user introduce the word "stop" the console application will show an invoice that contains details about the order such as a subtotal, shipping cost and the total amount of money the user needs to pay. In class Catalog I keep the lists of products that are in stock and for each product I keep its rate. In this class I have a method that adds a product to the list, search for a product in this list and return the shipping rate of a product. The class Product contains the characteristics that are specific to a product: name, itemPrice, rate(which is an object of type ShippingRate), weight and country. The ShippingRate class has only two attributes: country and rate.
